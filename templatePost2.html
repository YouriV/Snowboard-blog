            <p>Noah Salasnek needs no introduction. Noah’s fluid style helped define snowboarding as we know it today. Noah was a true visionary, his snowboarding inspired many. Noah is now faced with the biggest challenge of his life. We’d like to assist him in overcoming this obstacle. SIMS presents The Salasnek Reissue Package. Via lottery and randomly selected, 12 lucky people will be chosen to purchase 1 of the 12 packages which include:<br><br>

-One signed, made in the USA, individually numbered reissue of Noah’s 1993/94 1510 (The Nub) SIMS Pro Model snowboard.<br><br>

-One signed, made in the USA, individually numbered, reissue of Noah’s 1993/94 1550 SIMS Pro Model snowboard.<br><br>

-A Certificate of Authenticity signed by Noah, Mike McEntire, Dave Hatchett, Mike Hatchett, Chris Roach, Monty Roach and Aaron Vincent, founders of the Noah Salasnek Fund.<br><br>

That’s two signed reissue Noah Salasnek Pro Model snowboards, a signed print, and a signed Certificate of Authenticity. The Salasnek Reissue Package will cost $1800.00 plus shipping. 100% of the net proceeds will go directly to The Noah Salasnek Fund.
