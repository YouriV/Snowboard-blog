            <p>They stormed South Park in early April, decimating all transition in their path. The D-Day Snowboards crew, who officially welcomed Gooner to their team at Bowly, is made up of some talented riders who are known for their out-of-the-box approach to snowboarding when hitting more traditional features, so when the team rolled up to the creative set up at Mammoth, they really let loose on the rollers, berms, boobs, and hips. Luckily legit lensman Beef was there to record everything that went down. Presenting D-Day’s Coffee and Cigs featuring Lucas Magoon, Vinny, Cody Horan, Levi Faust, Deadlung, Dave Doman, Chris Roach, Mike Ranquet, Andrew Burns, and Jaromie the Homie.<br><br>
            It may be springtime in Vermont (with some hot, hot, hot temps this weekend), but there’s still a game to be played at Sugarbush and the team wasn’t about to throw in the towel for the fourth inning. Before the snow melted, the Northern VT crew hit a few homers in the Sugarbush park. The grandstands have been filled all season despite the below-average snowfall and while Jake Rose, Max Lyons, and Charlie Mayforth were batting 100, and free agents Sean Genovese and Marcus Rand brought the heat, the game was called on account of rising temps and will be picked back up when snow starts to fly next season.<br><br>

Featuring Connor Gross, Tyler Watson, Jake Rose, Max Lyons, Devon Gulick, River Richer, Char Zoeckler, Luke Haddock, Drew Baker, Sean Genovese, Nate Haust, Charlie Mayforth, and Marcus Rand.
